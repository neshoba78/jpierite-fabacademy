#### 2018 Review Notes

Aitor Aloa, is using Gitbook like me. He is considering migrating his repo to MK dot. He did the Hello Bus 45 and two nodes. He used Neil's code to program the board. Neil suggested that Aitor change the code just a little bit.

Abdulla, he only did research this week, due to being in a competition. He proposes to do two boards that will use Bluetooth. Neil suggested Fastel as a vendor for good Bluetooth modules.

Georges Hanna, his final project is an interactive lamp. He was behind on the weekly assignments. Neil showed a Bluetooth component at DigiKey which is "trivially compatible" with the ATTiny45. The component acts as a serial connection and similar to a text terminal.

Murad Saadeh, he used a ESP8266 and was able to send packets.

Coral, she worked on the I2C. Neil stated that I2C is a bit more complex for a networking beginner. Coral tried going through a tutorial on Sparkfun on why I2C is better than asynchronous.

Jari Uusitalo, he used board created in previous weeks. He created an Rx/Tx hub that talks to the boards from previous weeks. He demonstrated how modules can be connected by an external master board to create a system.

Tanvir Khorajiya, used bluetooth to sendthe data. He is broadcasting data to the boards through Bluetooth over a mobile app.
