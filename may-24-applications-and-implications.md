# Applications and Implications {#applications-and-implications}

#### Have you answered these questions:

* [ ] what will it do?

* [ ] who has done what beforehand?

* [ ] what materials and components will be required?

* [ ] where will they come from?

* [ ] how much will it cost?

_The answers to the questions above will allow you to create your BOM, or Bill Of Materials._

* [ ] what parts and systems will be made?

* [ ] what processes will be used?

* [x] what tasks need to be completed?

* [ ] what questions need to be answered?

* [x] what is the schedule?

* [ ] how will it be evaluated?

Complete your final project, tracking your progress:
what tasks have been completed, and what tasks remain? 
what has worked? what hasn't?
what questions need to be resolved?
what will happen when?
what have you learned?
Project management:
documentation during development
demand- vs supply-side time management
spiral development
system integration
finish
      
Document a final project that integrates the range of units covered, 
answering:
What does it do?
Who's done what beforehand?
What did you design?
What materials and components were used?
Where did they come from?
How much did they cost?
What parts and systems were made?
What processes were used?
What questions were answered?
How was it evaluated?
What are the implications?
Your project should incorporate 2D and 3D design,
additive and subtractive fabrication processes,
electronics design and production,
microcontroller interfacing and programming,
system integration and packaging
Where possible, you should make rather than buy
the parts of your project
Projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual 
mastery of the skills, and be independently operable 
Present your final project, weekly assignments, and documentation
