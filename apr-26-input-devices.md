#### Class Review 2016

João Leão from Fab Lab Barcelona tried to do the step from Matt. The problems that he encountered were centered around libraries that needed to be installed. The attempt was around trying to run functions that were included in Node.js, which was a different version from his local installation. Neil reminded him to include design files for repo uploads. One comment that Neil made was that the black plastic connector on the FTDI connector should be mounted on the board. If this is not included in the design, every time the cable is connected to the board it will bend the solder joints.
