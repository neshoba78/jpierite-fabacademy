**2016 Review**

Vigyan Ashram presented an interesting project called "Mudra". They proposed a point of sale unit for blockchain currency. The name is a refernce to Hindu spirituality. Mudras are gestures with an energetic seal of authenticity. This prompted me to research block chain applications for Intellectual Property Management.

Not much discussion on intellectual property and business models. Most of the focus of this review was on final project proposals and machine building presentations.

**2017 Class Notes**

Invention sounds like an intangible thing, but there are many things to learn about managing it. "Science The Endless Frontier" written by Vannevar Bush led to the creation of the National Science Foundation. Created a notion taht you do basic research, applied research, and then commercialize. This is not how it actually happens.

Neil's suggestion is a "ready, fire, aim" model. "A Low-Cost Electromagnetic Tagging Technology for Wireless Identification, Sensing, and Tracking of Objects" by Richard Ribon Fletcher was the research behind shop-lifting tags. An unexpected consequence of that research led to a method for making quantum computers ("Bulk Spin-Resonance Quantum Computation", Neil A. Gershenfeld and Isaac L. Chuang). At this point the "ready" was the making of shoplifting tags. Making those tags in the "fire" stage led to the consequence of creating quantum computers. Knowing that quantum computers were an achievable target, the "aim" stage took the work further and created practical ways to interrogate molecular structures ("Ultra-small-sample molecular structure detection using microslot waveguide nuclear spin resonance", Yael Maguire, Isaac L. Chuang, Shuguang Zhang, and Neil Gershenfeld). As a second iteration of the aim stage, Neil's students then made radio which spun off to a company that makes readers for RFID tags.

Traffic and pain are ingredients to the flow of invention. Neil uses the example of "Electric Field Imaging" by Joshua Reynolds Smith which proposed a method of tomography using electric fields. Pain is an issue or problem, Neil's example being infants killed by motor vehicle air bags. This pain led Nidec Elesys to ask if Smith's tomography method could be used in motor vehicles. The collaboration resulted in the dominant sensor for motor vehicle airbags.

In these examples, Neil walks students through the unintended consequences of the iterative process. "None of this could happen, without doing the homework." homework is then a series of simple iterations which upon analysis lead to greater discoveries. These discoveries could very well be tangential, but rely upon a taril of documentation and testing. Traffic and pain come into play when two parties whether acquainted or not discover each other and collaborate. Synergies are exploited and new tools and processes are invented.

Neil continues that this process of invention is dependent upon ecosystems. "New report outlines MIT's global entrepreneurial impact" by Rob Matheson presents the output of businesses by alumni of MIT as the world's 10th largest economy, somewhere between Russia and India. Why this happens is because MIT is environment taht fosters "traffic" which brings projects from "fire" to "ready" to "aim". The Fab Lab Network, therefore, is another ecosystem for invention. While one fab lab is not a critical mass, the international network is.

Simple projects and documentation shared or "trafficked" (in the invention context) can then be used to solve issues or "pain" (no matter how tangential) within other parts of the network.
