#### 2016 Class Review

[Siew Chin Yue](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabsingapore/students/156/exercise12.html), Fab Lab Singapore, was introduced by Steven Lai Keat Chew. She used 123D to make the model of the tooling, then 3D printed. Neil reminded her that the goal of the assignment was to make the tooling using three-axis machining. Machineable wax can be used in ways that are different from 3D printed tooling. It allows for better surface finishes. It can be melted down and reused. It can make things larger than the build area of most 3D printers. Siew Chin Yue made a separate box, which Neil added should have been part of the toolpath calculation. She used [Easy Mold Silicone Rubber](https://www.eti-usa.com/easymold-silicone-rubber) cured in a vacuum gas chamber for over 24 hours. Neil then mentioned Oomoo which is in the recommended fab lab inventory. Oomoo demolds much faster than 24 hours. Oomoo cures at room temperature and can be demolded within an hour under optimal conditions. Siew Chin Yue used an epoxy resin which takes more time to cure. This resulted in Siew's documentation to be incomplete by class time. Steven joined the conversation when asked if the lab had access to Hydrostone or Drystone for casting media. During the discussion, it was mentioned that I or Jean-Michel Molenaar would develop a global supply chain for class materials. We did, for the 2017 cycle, develop class kits. These were adopted at a very low rate, given the coast of shipping, duties, and taxes. A world map of Smooth-On suppliers can be found, [here](https://www.smooth-on.com/distributors/).
