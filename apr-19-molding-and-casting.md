# Molding and Casting {#moulding-and-casting}

#### Have you:

* [ ] Explained how you made your files for machining

* [ ] Shown how you made your mould and cast the parts

* [ ] Described problems and how you fixed them

* [ ] Included your design files and ‘hero shot’ photos of the mould and the final object

#### 2016 Class Review

[Siew Chin Yue](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabsingapore/students/156/exercise12.html), Fab Lab Singapore, was introduced by Steven Lai Keat Chew. She used 123D to make the model of the tooling, then 3D printed. Neil reminded her that the goal of the assignment was to make the tooling using three-axis machining. Machineable wax can be used in ways that are different from 3D printed tooling. It allows for better surface finishes. It can be melted down and reused. It can make things larger than the build area of most 3D printers. Siew Chin Yue made a separate box, which Neil added should have been part of the toolpath calculation. She used [Easy Mold Silicone Rubber](https://www.eti-usa.com/easymold-silicone-rubber) cured in a vacuum gas chamber for over 24 hours. Neil then mentioned Oomoo which is in the recommended fab lab inventory. Oomoo demolds much faster than 24 hours. Oomoo cures at room temperature and can be demolded within an hour under optimal conditions. Siew Chin Yue used an epoxy resin which takes more time to cure. This resulted in Siew's documentation to be incomplete by class time. Steven joined the conversation when asked if the lab had access to Hydrostone or Drystone for casting media. During the discussion, it was mentioned that I or Jean-Michel Molenaar would develop a global supply chain for class materials. We did, for the 2017 cycle, develop class kits. These were adopted at a very low rate, given the coast of shipping, duties, and taxes. A world map of Smooth-On suppliers can be found, [here](https://www.smooth-on.com/distributors/). A map of distributors for USG can be found, [here](https://www.usg.com/content/usgcom/en/resource-center/tools/where-to-buy.html).

[Miki Nakazawa](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabkyushu/students/200/exercise12.html), Fab Lab Kyushu (Japan), machined a button. Miki used a 3mm square end mill for rough cutting and a 0.5mm ball end mill for finishing. Rough cutting took only 15 minutes. For the finishing, it took many passes which took hours. Miki used Rhino to model the button, because the program is useful for editing stl files. Miki was not able to finish casting her assignment. For her final project, Miki wanted to develop a puppet that functions as an alarm clock which would also remind a user of appointments. This led Neil to recommend Fiore Basile's digital companion [final project](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2014/students/basile.fiore/project/index.html). This similar to the toy alligator that I proposed in 2015. Each project would be helpful for me to focus the scope of my resulting final project.

[Adriana Cristina Cabrera Galindez](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabkamplintfort/students/124/11molding_casting.html), Fab Lab Kamp-Lintfort (Germany), was only able to complete machining the wax and creating the mold with silicone. On her completed page, there were two examples of mold making and casting. One was a washable gyro which was a lilypad sensor embedded in a part cast from Axson UR 3440. Adriana did not originally succeed, instead there was too much air in the mold which resulted in the part not curing. Another example was a kinder egg, the mold was made with an aljinate and cast in chocolate.
