#### Testing Composites

![](/assets/resize-IMG_2675.JPG)

We decided to make a test composite as a group. We found a 3" x 5" x 1.75" piece of foam. We measured and cut out a piece of nylon film (Composite Envisions Model 1952). This would form a vacuum bag that was approxiamtely 12" x 12" when folded over. The reason for the space was to accomodate for the height of the part. We did a mockup of layups for the compsite. Belo the tooling we place a piece of Green Resin Flow (Composite Envisions Model 1303). This served as a bottom bleeder layer. Above the tooling, we placed a piece of Airtech Econostitch Peel Play (Composite Envisions Model 1311). This would allow for easier removal of the tooling. We laid three plies of burlap. We cut enough of the fabric to allow for a lip at the bottom of the part. We also cut the fabric diagonally at the corners to fold the fabric over. We added a top layer of peel ply and then finally a layer of green resin flow. We did consider using quilting batting for a breather layer. Jean-Michel Molenaar advised that this was optional.

We started the lay up with a 1:1 ratio of epoxy (Entropy Resins Super Sap ONE) to hardener (Entropy Resins Super Sap ONF). We mixed the parts A & B for about a minute. We took care not to vigorously mix and start the curing process. Once the mixture was ready, we placed each piece of burlap in the mixture to impregante the fabric. From the point of mixing on, everyone who was in contact with the mixture wore nitrile gloves. As each piece was done, we laid them onto the peel ply on the tooling. Each time, we took care to recreate our decisions of lay up during the mock up stage. The decisions were based on the warp and weft of the fabric and trying our best to alternate the directions.

Once the tooling, peel ply, impregnated fabric, and bleeder layers were set; we set a nozzle and PVC tubing into the vacuum bag. We used vacuum bag sealant fom General Sealants on the nozzle and the edges of the vacuum bag. With the bag closed up, we attached a PVC tube to a vacuum chamber and air compressor (CPS VP4D 2 Stage Vacuum Pump).

Upon review of the Super Sap [Technical Data Sheet](https://entropyresins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ONE-TDS.pdf), the pot life is 18 minutes. This is the time needed for a mixture's viscosity to double or quadruple. The tack free time for the fast hardener is 3 hours. This is the time when a coating is properly adhered and protecting the surface. The mix ratio is actually 2:1 on the technical data sheet and not 1:1 as we mixed it.

We began vacuuming the air and excess mixture out of the vacuum bag. There were areas where the sealant was not air tight. We used a clamp to adjust. We initially set the vacuum for 18 minutes, thinking of the pot life. An hour went by, and the vacuum was still running. The air compressor began to smoke. So, we decided to shut this off. We started to take apart the vacuum bag, but noticed that the part, peel ply, and bleeder layers were still very tacky. So, we decided to leave this overnight to air dry in the fab lab.

The next day, we returned to the lab to check on the part. It was not as tacky as the day before. It took a lot of hand work to pry the peel ply and bleeder layers from the part. Between the composite part and the tooling, the peel ply was harder to pull up. I decided to break apart the foam tooling and dig out the peel ply. Once everything was cleared, I started the "whack test."
